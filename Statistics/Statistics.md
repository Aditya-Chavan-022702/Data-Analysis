Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analysing data. Data is nothing but facts or pieces of information, that can contribute towards understanding a particular situation to help us make better decisions for the future. 

#### Descriptive Statistics - Summarizing, Analysing and Visualizing Data

<font color="#4f81bd">Definition</font>: Descriptive Statistics is the science of organizing and summarizing data.

#### Inferential Statistics - Testing

<font color="#4f81bd">Definition:</font> Taking the collected data to test and form conclusions or inferences.  

#### Population and Sampling Techniques
1. <font color="#4f81bd">Population:</font> The group of data that we are interested in studying, this can include variety of data that is related to the subject of concern.
2. <font color="#4f81bd">Sampling:</font> A subset of the population to study and analyse for inferencing.
3. <font color="#4f81bd">Sampling Techniques:</font> How do we choose the subset?
	1. The goal of the technique is to choose a appropriate sample that can represent the entire population, it wont be always accurate, but should be accurate enough to give a understanding of the overall population.
	2. <font color="#f79646">Simple Random Sampling:</font>
		1. Random selection of samples where every member of the population denoted as <font color="#c0504d">(N)</font> has an equal chance of being selected  for your sample denoted as <font color="#c0504d">(n)</font>. 
		2. Ex: If you have a population of 1000 and a sample size of 100 then P(Selection) = n/N meaning, there is a 0.10% chance for each member of the population to be a part of the sample size of 100.
			1. <font color="#f79646">Why it is useful?</font>
				1. <font color="#9bbb59">Unbiased choice:</font> Since there is no systematic bias in the choice and the chosen samples are purely random, the samples should reflect the average effectively if not accurately. 
				2. <font color="#9bbb59">Statistical Validity:</font> When the equal chance condition is considered and the sample is large enough, we can confidently generalize the sample accuracy from the population.
	3. <font color="#f79646">Stratified Sampling:</font> Non overlapping samples that can be layered.
		1. Samples are considered based on unique criteria of individual elements of the population. Care needs to be taken that they are unique and shouldn't overlap based on the selection criteria.
		2. Ex: Male and Female.
	4. <font color="#f79646">Systematic Sampling:</font> In this method we select every k<sup>th</sup> element from a list after a random start.
		1. Define the population size <font color="#c0504d">(N)</font>
		2. Define the Sample size <font color="#c0504d">(n)</font>
		3. Compute the Sample Interval <font color="#c0504d">(k)</font> = <font color="#c0504d">N/n</font> rounded to the nearest integer. 
		4. Select a random starting point <font color="#c0504d">(r)</font> from 1 to k. 
		5. Selecting every k<sup>th</sup> element, r, r + k , r + 2k . . ., r + (n-1)k.
			1. <font color="#f79646">Why use it? </font>
				1. Simplicity: Once we have k, we need not generate n random numbers, just one random start.
				2. Good Spread within samples.
				3. Predictable Sample size.
			2. <font color="#f79646">Things to consider: </font>
				1. Periodic Patterns: If your population consists of a pattern of data then choosing a random number that aligns with that pattern may result in bias.
			3. <font color="#f79646">When to use?</font> 
				1. Quality Audits
				2. Web Analytics
				3. Surveys
	5. <font color="#f79646">Convenience Sampling:</font> Voluntary Response Sampling.
		1. Sampling based on the relatability of the inference to be made. 
		2. ex: If we need a inference based on medical data, we will go and survey doctors.
